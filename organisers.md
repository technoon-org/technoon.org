This guide takes you through everything you need to get sorted in
order to run a TechNoon course.

If you have any questions or need support, we'd love to chat with
you - you can get in touch with questions or to arrange a call via the
[TechNoon contact form](/contact/).


## Primary Checklist

To run a TechNoon training course - here's what you need:

* **Material** - you have selected, reviewed, and briefly rehearsed
  the material you plan to run.
  * Check out our [ready-to-go course material](#course-materials)
* **Venue** - you have **booked** a venue for the required time
  for the relevant dates e.g. four Wednesdays in a row
  * Make sure you include time for set-up and tidy-up - e.g. for a
    11:30am - 1:30pm TechNoon, we recommend booking your venue from at
    least 11:15am - 1:45pm.
* **Attendee Limit** - you have decided **how many** people you
  can handle
  * Check the maximum capacity of the room you've booked
* **Helpers** - you have another person to help with managing the
  event and/or delivering the content.
  * We've found having one organiser to focus on presenting the course
    and one organiser to focus on managing logistics works well.
  * You may want more helpers if you intend to cater for larger
    numbers.
* **Sign-Up** - you have made an on-line sign-up form for
  attendees.
  * Make it clear on the form that you can only accept applications
    from attendees willing to commit to attending the entire course.

Once you have everything above sorted, we'd love to help promote your
event! Please let us know the following details via the [TechNoon
contact form](/contact/):

* Course title
* Names of organisers
* Dates and times
* Brief course description
* Target attendees e.g. beginners, experts, geo-spatial analysts, etc.
* Location
* A URL to the application form
* Maximum number of attendees


## Other Considerations

### Venue

* Book a meeting room with ample space for the numbers signed up
  * The largest venues can be the hardest to reliably book - sometimes
    organisations reserve the right (understandably) to cancel your
    booking if senior executives want to use the room themselves.
  * Ideally have a backup room organised in case your primary booking
    gets cancelled
* Big screen(s) for screen sharing
* Power outlets for attendees' laptops (or most of them)
* OK to eat lunch in the meeting room
  * To be clear: You don't need to supply food, but attendees should
    be allowed to bring their own food from home or any nearby
    takeaway shops
  * You may want to remind attendees not to bring any food that would
    be too smelly for a shared space
* It should be easy to find/access the meeting room (this should be an
  easier requirement during the day)
* WiFi
  * Because some corporate network restrictions may interfere with
    some websites and package installations - check that all material
    that you intend to use will be accessible from the WiFi
* Nice to have:
  * Whiteboard + pens can be helpful
  * Microphone if there is a large number of attendees e.g. a lapel
    mic for the speaker and a run-around hand mic for questions
    (helpers can take it to people with questions)
* Set-Up and Tear-Down
  * Make sure the room is returned to its original state e.g. no lunch
    crumbs on floor etc - leave the room better than you found it
  * Arrive at least half an hour early for the first sessions to iron
    out any wrinkles, handle any surprises
* Feel free to allow the venue sponsor to speak briefly welcoming
  people or explaining their support for PyNoon

### People

* Instructor (and one backup in case the main instructor becomes
  unavailable)
* Helper(s)
  * We've found 2 - 3 helpers to be enough for approx 40 learners
  * 1 might be enough for a smaller group
  * Helpers need to be able to help learners resolve simple problems
    e.g. syntax errors, and escalate issues to the instructor so they
    can address the most common issues - perhaps to the whole group
  * Good to provide brightly coloured lanyards that identify
    organisers and helpers - ideally with their names

### Promotion

* Clearly indicate your intended audience. E.g. if your course is
  intended for people in the workforce, or for students.
* Include a few details and a link to a website providing all details
  and also to the digital sign-up form
  * Use the [original PyNoon application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfko2Kb-hxFJjlLTNq2XeauhTVcSTvzQO0e8OfBblxBtK3S7Q/viewform)
    as a reference
  * At the top of the form, include:
    * A link to the main site that explains the course format - e.g.
      [technoon.org](https://technoon.org) or an appropriate sub-site
      like [technoon.org/pynoon](https://technoon.org/pynoon)
    * Descriptive text or images about your course instance
    * Dates and topics
  * A Google form will provide a Spreadsheet of form responses, which
    you can extend with more details about attendees (e.g. tracking
    attendance)
* Early on ask if it is OK to get a photo or two for promotional
  purposes
* Share with relevant mailing lists and user groups. E.g. Python NZ
  mailing list and Slack
  * Encourage experienced people to let colleagues in their workplace
    know; and to possibly volunteer as helpers
* Share on social media
  * e.g. LinkedIn, X, mastodon, or wherever makes sense for your
    audience
  * Use an image appropriate hashtags, e.g. #technoon #pynoon #python
  * This really gets the message out! For example:<br>
    ![Screenshot of LinkedIn post promoting a PyNoon course](/_images/original_pynoon_linkedin_image.png)

### Communication

* Get set up to send bulk messages to attendees when you need to make
  announcements
  * If you're going to use email, make sure you BCC attendees so that
    you don't share their email addresses with each other!
  * You may like to set up a Slack or Discord channel for attendees
* You may like to set up a shared email account for all organisers of
  the course to use

#### Acknowledgment of acceptance into course

```
Hi,

Good news - your place in <course name> has been confirmed! Thank you so much for signing up, we're really excited that you and so many others are so keen to learn <topic>!

Here are the next steps:

1. If you can't commit to the full course, now is the time to let us know if you'd like to withdraw to make room for someone who can - we have a waiting list. There will be ways to catch up if you can't make it to every session, but we believe the full course commitment is important for you to really get the most value from the course.
2. If you can commit to the full course, please reply to this email to let us know and help us confirm numbers.
3. <Replace this step with any prep attendees need to perform, this is an example for PyNoon> Please test that the laptop you will be bringing to the course is able to access https://colab.research.google.com/ that we will be using for coding in the course. If you have any issues, please send us an email.
4. We look forward to seeing you for the first session on <date and time of first session>! The venue is <venue info, including how to get there>
5. Your time is valuable, and there's a lot to cover, so we're going to hit the ground running in the first session. Please make sure you're there at 11:30 sharp for the first session - we'll be helping make sure everyone is connected to the WiFi and set up to follow along with the live-coding lessons.

All the best,
<course name> Organisers - <organiser names>
```

#### Notification of being added to a waiting list

```
Dear applicant,

Thank you so much for signing up to <course name>, we're really excited that you and so many others are so keen to learn <topic>!

Unfortunately, we have received more applications than the capacity of the room, so we've had to add you to a waiting list, but we are double checking with everyone whether they are still able to commit to the course in case anyone withdraws. We will get back in touch if a space becomes available before the course starts. If no space becomes available, we will keep you on our mailing list for future courses.

All the best,
<course name> Organisers - <organiser names>
```

#### Inviting people to re-engage / catch up if they've missed a session

```
Hi <name>,

There are <count> weeks of <course name> to go.

Don't worry if you have missed one or two sessions. Join us for the final push - the next <count> <day of week>s from <date> to <date>.

You started off intending to complete the course, and we want you to complete the course.
We'll help you complete the course. Let's do this!

If you've fallen behind please reach out to us - we might have some ideas that could help. All the learning resources are available at <course material site> to help you catch up.

See you <day of week>,
<course name> Organisers - <organiser names>
```

#### Adding people who have not attended lessons to the waiting list

```
Hi <name>,

Hope all is well. We haven't heard back from you since we sent you your invite to attend <course name>, and we didn't see you at the first session on <date>. We're assuming that you are no longer available to attend the current course, so we're going to open up your space for someone on the waitlist. If you're still interested in attending <course name>, we will keep you on our mailing list for future courses.

All the best,
<course name> Organisers - <organiser names>
```

#### Evaluation Survey

We've found a physical/in-person evaluation survey gets better
engagement than an online form (which people forget to fill out).

```
1. What should we change?
   * What should we do more of?
   * What should we do less of?
   * What should we add?
2. How much are you already using <topic>?
   * Circle answer on scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (using daily)
   * Area for optional comment
3. Anything else you want to tell us?
```
