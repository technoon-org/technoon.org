## <img src="/_images/course-images/sql-hell.png" height="100" style="margin-right: 15px;"> [SQLNoon - Avoiding SQL Hell](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13CkfxWp7ZZVbQsJwtFcJ6err6JcqtRq9bU7JSx82izs/edit?ts=65f6602d){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

SQL queries are commonly mission critical for accurate reporting and
analysis but all too often they are unintelligible, difficult to
maintain, and potentially returning invalid results. In this 4-session
course we look at strategies for improving your queries and practices
around maintaining and documenting them and tracking changes.

Note - this course is not teaching SQL itself - it is expected that
participants will already know how to write basic SQL queries.
