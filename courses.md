PyNoon was originally run between November 2023 and March 2024 to
up-skill people in the worldâ€™s most popular programming language:
Python, which is used for automation, data science, web development,
and much more.

PyNoon covers the fundamentals of the Python programming language and
how to use Python to analyse and plot tabular data (e.g. spreadsheets)
and to interact with web services and AI models.

Generative AI is a powerful tool that individuals and businesses can
leverage through services like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and
Google's Gemini. However, AI has limitations we're not used to in
other technologies, creating risks of misuse and over-trusting. There
are also many concerns that AI raises - from practical issues of
privacy and security to fears of artificial super-intelligences!

AINoon is a course to cut through the hype and give you practical
hands-on experience using AI while providing you with understanding of
AI's strengths and limits to make good decisions about when and how to
use it.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Confidently use AI in a variety of ways to improve productivity
* Identify opportunities for incorporating AI into business solutions
* Critically consider the strengths, limitations, and risks of AI,
  based on a solid foundation of what AI is and how it works

Most importantly, AINoon provides a forum for asking questions about
AI and seeking assistance with your own use-cases.

## <img src="/_images/course-images/sql-hell.png" height="100" style="margin-right: 15px;"> [SQLNoon - Avoiding SQL Hell](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13CkfxWp7ZZVbQsJwtFcJ6err6JcqtRq9bU7JSx82izs/edit?ts=65f6602d){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

SQL queries are commonly mission critical for accurate reporting and
analysis but all too often they are unintelligible, difficult to
maintain, and potentially returning invalid results. In this 4-session
course we look at strategies for improving your queries and practices
around maintaining and documenting them and tracking changes.

Note - this course is not teaching SQL itself - it is expected that
participants will already know how to write basic SQL queries.

The more important your code, documentation, or database queries, the
more important it is to store it safely and to be able to track all
your changes. This is where Git comes in. Git is a powerful version
control tool which is now industry-standard. This 4-session course
starts from scratch, explaining why and how you should use Git. No
previous experience is required.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Use Git from the command-line
* Save, inspect, and restore every change to your files over time
* Collaborate with others using industry standard practices for branch
  management
