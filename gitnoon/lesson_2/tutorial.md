title: GitNoon Lesson 2
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Configure your GitHub account to support SSH authentication
2. Share repos on GitHub
3. Update remote and local repos
4. Instruct Git to ignore certain files
5. Publish a repo as a website on GitHub

> Note: While this tutorial makes use of GitHub, it should be
> reasonably straightforward to adapt its contents to an alternative
> hosting provider, like GitLab.


## Configuring your GitHub account to support SSH authentication

*Following instructions from:
[docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)*

GitHub (and most Git hosting providers) support two types of
connection:

1. `HTTPS`, with authentication based on username and password
2. `SSH`, with authentication based on a *private key* you keep on
   your machine, and a *public key* that you share with GitHub

We're going to use `SSH`, which is generally the preferred option and
is simpler when your account has Two-Factor Authentication enabled.

To do so, whenever we want to use Git on a new machine, we'll need to:

1. Generate an SSH keypair to identify your machine
   * You can skip this if you already have a key on your machine that
     you want to use
2. Add your public key to your GitHub account

### Generating an SSH keypair

To generate a new SSH keypair, open a terminal and run:

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

* If you have an older system that doesn't support `ed25519`, use:
  * `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"`
* You will be asked if you want to protect your private key with a new
  password
  * You should ideally use a password generated by a password manager

This will create two files in an `.ssh` directory under your home
directory, which we can list with:

```
ls -l ~/.ssh
```

You should see:

* A private key: `id_ed25519` (or similar)
* A public key: `id_ed25519.pub` (or similar)

### Adding your public key to your GitHub account

1. Visit `github.com` in your web browser
2. Click on your profile picture, and select `Settings`
3. Under `SSH and GPG keys`, select `New SSH key`
4. Fill in the following details:
   1. Title: Use a name that identifies your machine, e.g. `work-laptop`
   2. Key type: `Authentication Key`
   3. Key: Paste the contents of your **public** key, which you can
      get by running:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* To copy-paste:
  * In Git Bash on Windows, right-click to get copy/paste options or
    enable Ctrl+Shift shortcuts in Git Bash options.
  * On macOS you can pipe content to the clipboard: `cat
    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy`
  * On Ubuntu, highlight the text to copy and then middle click to
    paste.
* Git also supports using keys to cryptographically sign your
  commits - providing evidence that it was actually you who made a
  commit bearing your name and email address.
* If anyone else ever gains access to your private key, you should
  delete it from your GitHub account.


## Sharing repos on GitHub

### Pushing your repo

Let's create a repository on GitHub to publicly share the blog we made last week:

1. Visit `github.com` in your web browser
2. From the `+` dropdown at the top-right, select `New Repository`
3. Fill in the following details:
   * Name: `blog`
   * Visibility: `Public`
   * **Don't** add a README or any other files

Your new repository will be completely empty, with no commits.

Now let's connect your local `blog` repo to this remote repo on GitHub:

1. From your repo's GitHub page, find the `Quick setup` instructions
2. Select the `SSH` tab, and copy the URL
3. Open your repo's directory in a terminal (`cd blog`)
4. Add the **remote** to your repository:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/blog.git
```

> **IMPORTANT:** If the network you are on does not allow traffic over
> SSH port 22, you will need to use a different URL format:
> ```
> git remote add origin ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/<username>/blog.git
> ```

To check our remote has been added successfully, run:

```
git remote -v
```

* We can potentially connect multiple remote repositories to
  push/fetch code to/from.
* `origin` is the conventional name for the primary remote.

Now let's push the current state of the local repository
(specifically, the `main` branch we have been working on) to the
`origin` remote:

```
git push -u origin main
```

* You may need to accept the authenticity of the Git remote's
  fingerprint - you can double-check it at:
  [docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints)
* You may also be prompted for your SSH private key's password

Go back to your repo on GitHub and you should see your blog files!

### Cloning your neighbour's repo

Now try cloning your neighbour's repo:

1. Ask your neighbour for the link to their repo on GitHub
2. From the repo page, find the `Code` dropdown, and copy the SSH URL
3. In a new terminal, clone their entire repository into a new
   directory called `friend-blog` by running:

```
git clone git@github.com:<friend-username>/blog.git friend-blog
```

> Again, if the network you are on does not allow traffic over
> SSH port 22, you will need to use a different URL format:
> ```
> git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/<username>/blog.git friend-blog
> ```

Have a look at their blog posts!

```
cd friend-blog
ls -l
cat entry_1.md
```

## Updating remote and local repos

We should add a README file to every repo to provide a starting point
for anyone looking at it (including our future selves!).

Let's each add a README to our own repo, then fetch the README that
our neighbour added into our local clone of their repo.

### Pushing a README to our remote repo

First, go back to the terminal opened to your own blog's directory,
and create a `README.md` file:

```
nano README.md
```

Give it the following content's

```
# My Blog

## Contents

* [Entry 1](entry_1.md)
```

Save and exit `nano` (`Ctrl + x`, `y`, `Enter`), then add and commit
the README:

```
git status
git add README.md
git status
git commit
# Commit message: Add README
git status
```

* With that last `git status`, you should see that your branch is
  "ahead of origin/main by 1 commit"
* `origin/main` is a **remote reference** that tells us what the
  `main` branch looked like on the `origin` remote the last time we
  cloned or "fetched" from that remote.
* We can indeed see that (based on our last fetch), `origin/main` does
  not yet have our latest commit:

```
git log
```

To publish the latest commits from the local copy of our branch to the
remote, we just need to run:

```
git push
```

Now check the status and log again, and see that `origin/main` has
been updated:

```
git status
git log
```

Finally, refresh your repo's page on GitHub, and see that you have a
fancy-looking README file!


### Fetching the README of our neighbour's repo

Now go back to the terminal open in your `friend-blog/` directory, and
fetch the latest commits:

```
git fetch
```

Now `git status` tells us that our local repo is *behind* the remote
by 1 commit:

```
git status
```

We can also see this from the log:

```
git log origin/main
```

* Because `git log` defaults to showing us commits on our current
  local branch, we need to tell it to look at commits on the remote
  branch

Because we haven't made any commits of our own since we last
cloned/fetched, we can simply tell Git to update our local branch by
"fast-forwarding" through all of the commits on the remote branch:

```
git merge --ff-only origin/main
```

* `--ff-only` tells Git to only update our local branch if it is
  possible to "fast-forward".
* If we *had* made our own local commits, fast-forwarding wouldn't be
  possible, and we'd need to take a different approach.
* We'll look at that case along with branches and `git merge` in more
  detail in the next lessons.
* **NOTE:** Some tutorials might teach you to use `git pull`, which
  performs both a `fetch` and `merge` from one command
  * Recommendation: Avoid using `pull` until you fully understand how
    merges work, and the implications of the different ways the `pull`
    command can be configured.


## Telling Git to ignore certain files

Sometimes we have files that we don't want Git to track, especially
when sharing repos with others:

* Local configuration that doesn't need to be shared
* Secrets that shouldn't be shared (like API keys)
* Temporary editor lock files
* Locally-installed dependency packages
* Outputs of build/compilation processes

For example, let's say we have a file containing some secrets:

```
touch secrets.txt
```

Git is ready for us to start tracking it:

```
git status
```

But we will tell Git to never track that file by adding its path to a
`.gitignore` file:

```
nano .gitignore
```

Add the following line into `.gitignore`:

```
secrets.txt
```

Now Git will ignore `secrets.txt`, though we will need to make sure we
commit the `.gitignore` file:

```
git status
```


## Publishing your repo as a website on GitHub

Finally, let's use GitHub's **Pages** feature to publish your blog as
a static website!

1. Open your repo's page on GitHub
2. Go to `Settings -> Pages`
3. Select `Deploy from a branch`, select the `main` branch, then
   `Save`
4. Open your website at: `https://<username>.github.io/blog`
   * Refreshing the Pages settings should also display the link.
   * You may need to wait a minute for it to be published.

You can make a pretty fancy blog or documentation website on GitHub
pages with a static site tool like Jekyll, or by crafting your own
HTML and CSS.


## Conclusion

* You have now learned how to work with remote Git repositories
* In the next lesson, you'll learn how to use Git's branching and
  merging features, which are especially important for managing
  multiple people working on the same repository.
