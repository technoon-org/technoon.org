### What is Git?

::: incremental

<div class="top-fragment-only">

* Git is a tool to record **versions** of files over time
* Git works with **any type of file**
  * Git works *especially well* with **plain-text** like source-code
    and config
* The most popular Version Control System (VCS)
  * [About **90%** of devs use Git for version control](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/09/beyond-git-the-other-version-control-systems-developers-use/)

### Why use Git?

::: incremental

<div class="top-fragment-only">

1. **Backup every version of your files**
   * Being able to *restore any previous version* gives you confidence
     to make radical changes
2. **Seamlessly collaborate with others**
   * Everyone can *work on the same files at the same time*, then
     combine their changes later
3. **Explore file history**
   * Every version in Git records the author, date, and change
     description
   * Find *who* made a change, *when*, and *why*

### What about GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc?

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

* Online services for **hosting/sharing Git repositories**
  * Many can be self-hosted in your corporate environment
  * Some have an open-source edition, like GitLab
* Provide features for:

* **Change Control**
  * *Pull/Merge requests* with discussions and approvals
* **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD)**
  * Automated checks and tests, deploying code
* **Static web hosting**
  * Turn a Git repository into a website - great for docs!
* **And more**
  * Issue tracker, security scanning, container registries

### What to expect from GitNoon

::: incremental

<div class="top-fragment-only">

* Each lesson will have:
  * A **10-20 minute presentation**
  * A **25-45 minute hands-on tutorial**
* We'll use Git from the **command-line** / **terminal**
  * The fundamentals you'll learn apply to any GUI
  * A GUI is not always available (e.g. on a server)
  * No previous command-line experience required
* We'll focus on **Git itself**
  * Less on specific features of services like GitHub
