# GitNoon Curriculum

Slides and tutorials for GitNoon.

## Lesson Guide for Instructors

### Before the Lesson

1. Print out the **Tutorial Speaker Notes** for the lesson so that you can read from them as you type code in a notebook
2. Familiarise yourself with the slides and speaker notes for the lesson
   * Practising the material, even by yourself, helps build confidence in the flow of the lesson!

### Slides

1. From the start of the lesson, have the initial "Get ready" or "Warm-Up Exercise" slide in the lesson's slide deck displayed on the screen.
   * Disable auto-sleep on your machine so the slides stay up even when you're not moving the mouse
   * Turn off notifications on your machine
2. Once all attendees have arrived, continue through the administration slides in the slide deck
3. If there is a **Lunch Talk** (or **DEMO-ONLY** portion of the tutorial), present that during the lunch time (allocate about 20 minutes)

### Tutorial

1. After the lunch time, show the **Tutorial Objectives** slide to outline the material that the tutorial will cover
2. You and all attendees should open a terminal from which you can `git` commands
   * Use "Git Bash" on Windows to ensure everyone has a consistent terminal environment across operating systems
   * Increase the font-size of your terminal to ensure all attendees can comfortably read it
   * Bring up the bottom of your terminal window if it won't be visible from all seats
3. Work through the **Tutorial Speaker Notes** for the lesson
   * Have the speaker notes printed out ahead of time
   * Read out (or paraphrase) written material
   * Demonstrate each command example in the terminal
   * Have attendees type along and run commands with you, and regularly check if anyone needs assistance from a helper

### Exercise and self-directed learning

1. After the tutorial, present the **Independent Work/Homework** slide
2. Direct attendees to [technoon.org/gitnoon](https://technoon.org/gitnoon) to find the lesson's slides and tutorial
3. Also offer to help with any other course-related problems that attendees may have - such as from applying what they've learned in their job
