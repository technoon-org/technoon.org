# TechNoon Contact Form

If you are wanting to get involved, or if you want to make a
suggestion, please give us some brief details in the [TechNoon Contact
Form](/contact) and we'll get back to you.

# What can Industry do to support TechNoon?

* **Send trainees** - Encourage staff to up-skill through TechNoon -
  TechNoon is a lightweight, targeted, practical way of increasing the
  productivity and motivation of technical staff. At the end of a
  course, ask your staff "what did you improve as a result?"
* **Supply training venues** - Some courses will be small and
  specialised; others will be larger (the first TechNoon Python course
  had nearly 40 trainees, three helpers, and two trainers). A variety
  of venues in central locations will be needed - perhaps you can
  help.
* **Supply trainers** - Support suitable staff to deliver training.
  What would improve your technical infrastructure and practices most?
  Start there. Message staff with a list of possible courses asking 1)
  do you want to run any of them and 2) do you want to write and run a
  course not on the list? Over time, more course materials will be
  available for reuse.
* **Promote your involvement** - Let everyone know about your
  involvement in this exciting initiative. Promote your brand as a
  desired workplace for tech talent.

# Examples of possible courses

* Introductory Python
* Spreadsheets and automation
* Readable, maintainable SQL
* Tableau without tears
* Using main linux CLI tools
* Faster geospatial queries
* RevealJS presentations
* Using HTTP status codes properly
* Data visualisation tips
* Quicker container deployment (Docker)
* Unit testing using pytest
* Athena and DBeaver
* Better team documentation
* Human-friendly APIs
* When to Excel; when not to Excel
* Airflow and alternatives
* Regex for humans
* Type hinting in Python
* Practical use of specific cloud services
  * Ideally taught by practitioners and not vendors, but if the
    vendors can meet TechNoon's demands of practical training that
    actually achieves something, then go right ahead - some vendors
    may already be doing that.
* and much, much more

There is so much we can improve in our technical practice - together
we can all lift our game!

## Prompts for coming up with course ideas

* "We just got some graduates, and they don't even know &lt;technology&gt;"
* "Our team really needs to be doing &lt;practice&gt; better"
