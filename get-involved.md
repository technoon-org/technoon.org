# TechNoon Contact Form

If you are wanting to get involved, or if you want to make a
suggestion, please give us some brief details in the [TechNoon Contact
Form](/contact) and we'll get back to you.

# What can Industry do to support TechNoon?

* **Supply training venues** - Some courses will be small and
  specialised; others will be larger (the first PyNoon had nearly 40
  trainees, three helpers, and two trainers). A variety of venues in
  central locations will be needed - perhaps you can help.
* **Supply trainers** - Support suitable staff to deliver training -
  perhaps starting with a brief course and building up from there.
  What would improve your organisation's own technical infrastructure
  and practices most? Start there.
* **Send trainees** - Encourage staff to upskill through TechNoon.
  TechNoon is a lightweight, targeted, practical way of increasing the
  productivity and motivation of technical staff. The question to ask
  your staff at the end of a course is: "What did you improve as a
  result?"

# Examples of possible courses

* Introductory Python
* Spreadsheets and automation
* Readable, maintainable SQL
* Tableau without tears
* Using main linux CLI tools
* Faster geospatial queries
* RevealJS presentations
* Using HTTP status codes properly
* Data visualisation tips
* Quicker container deployment (Docker)
* Unit testing using pytest
* Athena and DBeaver
* Better team documentation
* Human-friendly APIs
* When to Excel; when not to Excel
* Airflow and alternatives
* Regex for humans
* Type hinting in Python
* Practical use of specific cloud services
  * Ideally taught by practitioners and not vendors, but if the
    vendors can meet TechNoon's demands of practical training that
    actually achieves something, then go right ahead - some vendors
    may already be doing that.
* and much, much more

There is so much we can improve in our technical practice - together
we can all lift our game!

## Prompts for coming up with course ideas

* "We just got some graduates, and they don't even know &lt;technology&gt;"
* "Our team really needs to be doing &lt;practice&gt; better"
