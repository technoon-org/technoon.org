### What is Vibe-coding?

TODO

First, what is *coding*?

> Coding how software developers build apps - writing instructions in
> a special language the computer can understand.

*Open the source view (`Ctrl-u`) on the technoon.org website to show
the code for that website.*

> *Vibe*-coding is describing an app to an agent and letting it write
> the code *without checking the code it writes* -

### Uses of Vibe-coding

TODO

* Enables coders and non-coders to rapidly build prototypes and simple
  apps for low-stakes use-cases
* It is not wise when privacy, security, or correctness are a concern
  * You might still do AI-assisted programming, but you should be
    thoroughly reviewing the code
* Probably not the best way to learn to code
* Don't use it to reinvent the wheel
  * There are plenty of apps out there for building websites and forms
* **Sweet spot:** automate time-consuming tasks that are specific to
  your work!

### Scaling up AI-Assisted Coding

TODO

For bigger and more complex projects:

* More advanced agents that work across a whole folder of files
  * Replit, Codex, GitHub Copilot
* Planning documents
* Version control - GitNoon
* Expert knowledge to guide it - more specific prompts, like with
  images


### Homework

TODO

* Research/consider risks and challenges
* Use replit - see how it makes a plan and generates a folder of files.
  * You might not get as far without a paid plan
