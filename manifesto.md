title: The TechNoon Manifesto

Industry needs training in technical skills that is:

* **On-the-job**
  * TechNoon is primarily for people already in technical jobs, not
    people trying to enter the workforce. There are lots of good
    training options for students seeking to be work-ready in
    technical careers - TechNoon is to upskill people already working.
* **In-person**
  * Learning technical skills is easier when it is done in a
    face-to-face community. There will usually be an on-line component
    of TechNoon but in-person sessions are central. People helping
    people is part of the TechNoon ethos.
* **Small weekly commitment**
  * People already in jobs are busy and can't usually devote long
    periods of time to skills training. TechNoon courses will usually
    have four sessions of 2-3 hours each (including homework)
    depending on the topic. That seems to be the practical maximum
    commitment we can expect. Given the practical emphasis of
    TechNoon, it should be possible to split longer topics into
    smaller courses, each with its own practical focus.
* **With multiple sessions**
  * Unlike one-day workshops, TechNoon courses are delivered as
    multiple sessions interspersed with work so that learning can be
    applied *between* sessions. This makes it possible for learners to
    bring practical questions and issues to subsequent sessions and
    avoid getting "stuck". It is also more motivating to learn
    something in sessions if there are regular attempts to apply that
    learning in practice. This is one of the main benefits of
    on-the-job training compared with academic training.
  * Learning technical skills takes time - spaced repetition and time
    *between* learning sessions helps new skills stick.
* **Around lunch-time**
  * TechNoon occurs around lunchtime to make it easier to fit into the
    work week and to build community.
* **At accessible locations**
  * Because TechNoon is a lunchtime activity, it is important that it
    is delivered in locations that are as close as possible to where
    people work. Industry support in the form of training venues is
    very important.
* **Practical and hands-on**
  * Teaching and homework will typically have a substantial hands-on
    component where learners are actually making something useful -
    for example: programming code, configuration, or documentation.
* **Industry-led**
  * Teachers will be people in industry with skills to share. TechNoon
    is about learning so it is crucial that teachers have good
    communication skills. This doesn't mean TechNoon can only be
    delivered by superstars. Although there will be individuals who
    are unicorns with great technical, communication, and
    administrative skills, a more common pattern is to deliver
    training as a small team. There needs to be technical expertise in
    the room but the person actually delivering the bulk of the
    teaching should have good communication skills and an orientation
    to teaching.
* **Free**
  * Because courses are by industry, for industry, the courses are
    free. Having said this, before people sign up to a course it is
    expected will be able to commit to the entire course, and meet the
    homework requirements.
  * Free means that managers don't need to get budget approval to send
    people to a paid course. Managers can just approve the time for
    their staff.
  * Furthermore, the overheads of running a paid course (managing
    payment, tax obligations, implication of some kind of
    certification) mean that TechNoon would be practical if it wasn't
    free.
* **With custom courses**
  * The flexibility of TechNoon encourages delivery of specialist
    courses for smaller numbers of learners. Some courses will be
    larger and more general (for example, an introduction to the
    Python programming language); but others might be less ambitious,
    (for example, a course on how to write readable, maintainable
    SQL); or more advanced, (for example, containerisation best
    practice).
* **Focused on practical results, not credentials**
  * At the end of a course the question to ask is not what
    certification was gained but *what specific skills were actually
    put to use in the existing work context*. Did the training make a
    practical, tangible difference? Is something different as a
    result?
  * This is arguably the key question that the trainer needs to keep
    front of mind while developing a course.
* **With open sourced content**
  * Teaching resources should be shared to reduce the effort required
    to increase technical skills in industry. TechNoon follows the
    open source ethos of "give a brick, get a building".
  * Less of an industry need, but more of a practicality to make this
    training actually happen.
  * Releasing teaching resources, including code, under a Creative
    Commons licence that ensures attribution will ensure companies
    that make successful training resources get the appropriate credit
    and recognition in return.
